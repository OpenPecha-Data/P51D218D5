Dharmakāya Transference
by Nyala Pema Dündul

Since this concerns the dharmakāya transference or the inherent potential that is the display
of the intrinsic buddha nature of all beings, whether you practise it for any other being—bird,
wild beast, domestic animal, fish, or even a leech—it is sealed with the view of the
dharmakāya nature of that being, and according to the four modes of liberation.
a kechik tong sal zungjuk ngang nyi lé
Āḥ!  In an instant, out of the state of the inseparable unity of clarity and emptiness,
özer yeshe rik druk né su trö
Rays of wisdom light shine out, travelling to all six realms,
semchen namshé a kar chik tu gyur
So that the consciousnesses of all beings transform into a single white syllable Āḥ, which
könchok tsa sum denpé jinlab kyi
Through the blessings of the truth of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and the Lama, Yidam and
Khandro,
chakgya shyi yi kuk né rang la tim
Is gathered with the four mudrās, dissolving into me.
salrik tongsum yermé nyukmé shi
The original nature, in which clarity, awareness and emptiness are indivisible.
poja pojé mepé ngowo nyi
Is the essence, in which there is nothing to be transferred and no transferrer.
drak tong jödral lodé hik dra dab
I utter the syllable Hik, which is inexpressible sound and emptiness, beyond the ordinary mind,
tadral rolpa chenpor ub chubwo
And everything is united and perfected within the great display that is beyond any limitation.
rangrik kyemé chökü ying su po
My own awareness is transferred into the expanse of the unborn dharmakāya.
hik hik hik
Hik! Hik! Hik!

This phowa practice was composed by the old beggar of Nyarong Lhangdrak named Dündul, in response
to requests made by the devoted lamas Orgyen Gyaltsen and Orgyen Garwang Gyaltsen. May
all beings who hear this instruction on the method of transference that brings enlightenment
without meditation attain the essence of awakening within their very own rigpa. Sarva
Buddha Maṅgalaṃ.
